Searchers of the Unknown Omnibus (ODT)
A friend of mine had been asking me for a few years now if we could play D&amp;amp;D. She has never played before and it got me thinking about the quickest and easiest way to introduce new players to tabletop roleplaying games.
I looked at HERE’S SOME FUCKIN’ D&amp;amp;D by Dustin R. I really liked the simplicity of it but felt the tone and mechanics were not quite what I was looking for.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I updated my Tilemap and Filepack Template to be compatible with Phaser 3.17, webpack 4, babel, and implemented pools for the player and enemy projectiles. I created the template a year ago and other than a minor compatibility update last fall haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it since.
Phaser 3 Tilemap &amp;amp; File Pack Project Template
Demo
The original idea of the template was to illustrate a concept I was trying to explain to another user over at HTML5GameDevs.</description>
