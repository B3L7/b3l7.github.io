      <description>Well we have a wacky one here kids! The group got together in between our normal campaign sessions to play a one-off and we finally got to check out a system I&amp;rsquo;ve been dying try for a while now. That system would of course be Maze Rats by Ben Milton. I wanted to pair this ultra-light system with a quick adventure so I opted again for a One Page Dungeon since the last one went so well.</description>

      <description>Last week I posted about my play test of the Searchers of the Unknown Omnibus using Temple of the Moon Priests. That session was enlightening and caused me to spend a lot of time thinking about SotU and the lessons I had learned. After talking to my players and many of you online, I decided to make some changes which culminated in version 3 of the Searchers of the Unknown Omnibus.</description>

      <description>Last week I shared my edit of Searchers of the Unknown which I call the Searchers of the Unkown Omnibus. At the time I talked about my desire to play test the minimalist system. It seems fate saw it as a priority as well. The opportunity arose later in the week when it became clear that my regular 5e campaign would be missing several players for a climactic session. We decided that rather than have anyone miss out on a session we had been building to for a year that it would be better to run a one off game with whoever could make it.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine had been asking me for a few years now if we could play D&amp;amp;D. She has never played before and it got me thinking about the quickest and easiest way to introduce new players to tabletop roleplaying games.
I looked at HERE’S SOME FUCKIN’ D&amp;amp;D by Dustin R. I really liked the simplicity of it but felt the tone and mechanics were not quite what I was looking for.</description>
