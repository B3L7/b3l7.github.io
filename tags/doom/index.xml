      <description>Download: Reactor Core
Requirements: Doom 2, GZDoom
I created this WAD a few years ago with the aim to make a megawad of several levels with a continuous story. That seems unlikely now so I am releasing it as is so people can play around with it. You can see up front that I was more interested in interesting aesthetics over unique game play. That being said I learned a lot in the process and I think it helped set me down the road to eventually getting into game development.</description>
