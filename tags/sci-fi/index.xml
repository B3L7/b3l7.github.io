      <description>Note: I originaly wrote this story 4 years ago for /r/writingprompts They came from the sky in a rain of fire and on that day the gods wept for they knew that we were doomed. You are asking me to describe them so do not blame me for the dread it will instill within you. Still it will be good for you to know what your undoing will look like. Perhaps it will prepare you in some way.</description>
