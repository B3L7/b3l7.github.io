      <description>We,
the angry maelstroms,
raged battles
across our mindscapes
against the ghosts
of those who never really
existed
while seeking allies
in those
who had yet to come.
We,
the pinpoints of thought,
sailed sleepily
through the sea
of silence
each believing in the other
while doubting
in ourselves.
We,
the dreams of God,
lay in wait
to be awakened.</description>
