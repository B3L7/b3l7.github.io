      <description>Download: Reactor Core
Requirements: Doom 2, GZDoom
I created this WAD a few years ago with the aim to make a megawad of several levels with a continuous story. That seems unlikely now so I am releasing it as is so people can play around with it. You can see up front that I was more interested in interesting aesthetics over unique game play. That being said I learned a lot in the process and I think it helped set me down the road to eventually getting into game development.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I updated my Tilemap and Filepack Template to be compatible with Phaser 3.17, webpack 4, babel, and implemented pools for the player and enemy projectiles. I created the template a year ago and other than a minor compatibility update last fall haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it since.
Phaser 3 Tilemap &amp;amp; File Pack Project Template
Demo
The original idea of the template was to illustrate a concept I was trying to explain to another user over at HTML5GameDevs.</description>
