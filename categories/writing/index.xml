      <description>Last week I posted about my play test of the Searchers of the Unknown Omnibus using Temple of the Moon Priests. That session was enlightening and caused me to spend a lot of time thinking about SotU and the lessons I had learned. After talking to my players and many of you online, I decided to make some changes which culminated in version 3 of the Searchers of the Unknown Omnibus.</description>

      <title>They Came From the Sky</title>

      <description>Note: I originaly wrote this story 4 years ago for /r/writingprompts They came from the sky in a rain of fire and on that day the gods wept for they knew that we were doomed. You are asking me to describe them so do not blame me for the dread it will instill within you. Still it will be good for you to know what your undoing will look like. Perhaps it will prepare you in some way.</description>

      <description>We,
the angry maelstroms,
raged battles
across our mindscapes
against the ghosts
of those who never really
existed
while seeking allies
in those
who had yet to come.
We,
the pinpoints of thought,
sailed sleepily
through the sea
of silence
each believing in the other
while doubting
in ourselves.
We,
the dreams of God,
lay in wait
to be awakened.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine had been asking me for a few years now if we could play D&amp;amp;D. She has never played before and it got me thinking about the quickest and easiest way to introduce new players to tabletop roleplaying games.
I looked at HERE’S SOME FUCKIN’ D&amp;amp;D by Dustin R. I really liked the simplicity of it but felt the tone and mechanics were not quite what I was looking for.</description>
