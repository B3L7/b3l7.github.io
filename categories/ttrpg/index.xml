      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s free RPG day but unfortunately I still do not have anything commercial to give away. But in the spirit of things here is this bastardization of SotU that I have been working on and off on:
Adventurers of the Uncharted v1 (PDF)
Adventurers of the Uncharted v1 (ODT)
I had planned to expand out the species, classes, feats, spells, etc. But with working on Dreamhaven and other projects I haven&amp;rsquo;t put much time in it.</description>

      <description>Sarah, Chris, and I decided to take a very short break from working on Dreamhaven Issue 1 to create a submission to the 2020 One Page Dungeon Contest.
In this heavenly train heist, you and your teen angel pals attempt to kidnap the mascot of your demonic counterparts from Infernal College.
So here it is:

We had a blast doing it and I think if we have time we will enter again next year.</description>

      <description>Well we have a wacky one here kids! The group got together in between our normal campaign sessions to play a one-off and we finally got to check out a system I&amp;rsquo;ve been dying try for a while now. That system would of course be Maze Rats by Ben Milton. I wanted to pair this ultra-light system with a quick adventure so I opted again for a One Page Dungeon since the last one went so well.</description>

      <description>Introduction A few months ago my regular D&amp;amp;D 5E group decided we wanted to play a one shot of Call of Cthulhu for Halloween. Many of our players were also in a book club together in which we are doing several Lovecraft stories for Halloween so we thought the coinciding game would be a fun crossover.

Last week I posted about my play test of the Searchers of the Unknown Omnibus using Temple of the Moon Priests. That session was enlightening and caused me to spend a lot of time thinking about SotU and the lessons I had learned.</description>

At the time I talked about my desire to play test the minimalist system. It seems fate saw it as a priority as well.</description>

A friend of mine had been asking me for a few years now if we could play D&amp;amp;D. She has never played before and it got me thinking about the quickest and easiest way to introduce new players to tabletop roleplaying games.
